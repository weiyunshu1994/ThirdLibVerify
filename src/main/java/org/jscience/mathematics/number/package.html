<p>Provides regression tests for the {@link
org.jscience.mathematics.number} package.</p>
<p>Running all tests is possible by running {@link
org.jscience.mathematics.number.AllNumberTests#main(String[])} .</p>
<p>The tests for Number, FloatingPoint, Rational are complete minus a few
trivial methods. Calculus is tested implicitly (it is used by
LargeInteger). Some methods of Float64 and Integer64 are currently
omitted, since these are just simple wrappers for double and long.
